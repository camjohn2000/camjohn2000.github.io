<p><h2>Platinum<h2>

	<p>I picked up Platinum as a spur of the moment things. Hearing her English voice actor, seeing her personality and cinematic gimmicks, I feel deeply in love with the character! She is definitely one of my all time favorite choices in this game. I have genuine love for this character!

	<p><h2>Blake Belladona</h2>

	<p>	I never took the time to watch the show RWBY aside from the first, if not the first few, episodes back in High School. Despite this, I had a desire to really play this character. I still do not know why, but I thorougly enjoyed learning her, playing her, and committing to her. She is very solid and her toolset mixed with her movement options are hella fun to experiment with!
