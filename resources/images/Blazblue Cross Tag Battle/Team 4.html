			<p>For 2.0, I wanted to play 80% of the new characters. Man.....she was supposed to be a part of my secondary team, but her teammate is/was unviable online so...I did not originally play her, but then I really gave her a shot. Now, she is my gal! I play her over anyone. She has hella short comings but she has MAJOR utility and potential! She is the Air-to-Air Gaaaaawwwwdddd!!!!

			<p>His personality blew me away. He seemed like the character that would piss you off getting hit by. His laughing, taunting, cursing, demeanor, boooiiiii!!!! He hits hella hard and has a great Persona! He has his shortcomings and has bad midrange, but he can play up close and far away. Dope character and fun with hella options!
