<p>I chose this character because she was the character I tried and settled down with in Under Night. She is such a great character. She is mobile, quick, has great close range and good mid range. Nice projectile, dope assists, and great mixups with an assist. Definitely fell for this character!
<p><h2>Chie</h2>
