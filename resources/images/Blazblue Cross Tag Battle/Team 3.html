		<p>She was a no brainer. I kept seeing her around and the name stuck with me. It must have been due to one of my homies repping her back on Xbox with her name and using her as a Gamer Pic. In truth I hella fell in love with her mobility!!! I am still heavily considering going back to play her. I loved her command movements. Her easy and conveninet throw confirms felt immensely fluid. Her escape options worked wonders. Her attack options seem linear due to her mid being a projectile but she is toooo stylish!!! TOOO STYLISH!!!!

			<p>I picked her soley for her accent. Well, there is more to it than that, but her accent...OHHH BOI!!!! She was cool. Very cool actually. Not very fact but she hits too hard!! I learned to use cross combos with this team and had some cool setups. Labrys could close out rounds on her own or make comebacks. She is that chick!!!
