	<p>I chose this character because she was the character I tried and settled down with in Under Night. She is such a great character. She is mobile, quick, has great close range and good mid range. Nice projectile, dope assists, and great mixups with an assist. Definitely fell for this character!

		<p>I picked up Platinum as a spur of the moment things. Hearing her English voice actor, seeing her personality and cinematic gimmicks, I feel deeply in love with the character! She is definitely one of my all time favorite choices in this game. I have genuine love for this character!<br>

		<p>I never took the time to watch the show RWBY aside from the first, if not the first few, episodes back in High School. Despite this, I had a desire to really play this character. I still do not know why, but I thorougly enjoyed learning her, playing her, and committing to her. She is very solid and her toolset mixed with her movement options are hella fun to experiment with!

		<p>I honestly do not even remember why I picked her up. I think at this point I told myself that I was going to pick up a new team with every new release of a DLC set. Regardless, she is hella fun to play. Like all my early teams, I never really fleshed her out much. Sad, but in reality, there were some really dope things I wanted to do with her. I have some very simple ideas for victories as well that I never put into practice. Still, she is hella dope!!!!

		<p>In all honestly, I only picked him up because, not only did I hear that he was really good, but I knew he would be hella annoying for my homie to deal with. It just so happened that I truly loved playing the character. So much so that at one point, he was my most played character. His entire concept is really unique and cool as hell. He uses his blood as a weapon. He throws it around inflicting point damage to himself while dealing massive damage to his oppoenents. Then the blood puddles he leaves around...goodness!!! Defintely one of my favorites!!!

		<!--<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1Av1CBY9pA&t=01m23s"><img src="pics/Mai.jpg" alt="Mai Natsume"></a>-->
		<p>She was a no brainer. I kept seeing her around and the name stuck with me. It must have been due to one of my homies repping her back on Xbox with her name and using her as a Gamer Pic. In truth I hella fell in love with her mobility!!! I am still heavily considering going back to play her. I loved her command movements. Her easy and conveninet throw confirms felt immensely fluid. Her escape options worked wonders. Her attack options seem linear due to her mid being a projectile but she is toooo stylish!!! TOOO STYLISH!!!!

			<p>I picked her soley for her accent. Well, there is more to it than that, but her accent...OHHH BOI!!!! She was cool. Very cool actually. Not very fact but she hits too hard!! I learned to use cross combos with this team and had some cool setups. Labrys could close out rounds on her own or make comebacks. She is that chick!!!

			<p>For 2.0, I wanted to play 80% of the new characters. Man.....she was supposed to be a part of my secondary team, but her teammate is/was unviable online so...I did not originally play her, but then I really gave her a shot. Now, she is my gal! I play her over anyone. She has hella short comings but she has MAJOR utility and potential! She is the Air-to-Air Gaaaaawwwwdddd!!!!

			<!--<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rty9lPflbwI"><img src="pics/Adachi.jpg" alt="Tohru Adachi"></a>-->
			<p>His personality blew me away. He seemed like the character that would piss you off getting hit by. His laughing, taunting, cursing, demeanor, boooiiiii!!!! He hits hella hard and has a great Persona! He has his shortcomings and has bad midrange, but he can play up close and far away. Dope character and fun with hella options!
