	<p>I honestly do not even remember why I picked her up. I think at this point I told myself that I was going to pick up a new team with every new release of a DLC set. Regardless, she is hella fun to play. Like all my early teams, I never really fleshed her out much. Sad, but in reality, there were some really dope things I wanted to do with her. I have some very simple ideas for victories as well that I never put into practice. Still, she is hella dope!!!!

		<p>In all honestly, I only picked him up because, not only did I hear that he was really good, but I knew he would be hella annoying for my homie to deal with. It just so happened that I truly loved playing the character. So much so that at one point, he was my most played character. His entire concept is really unique and cool as hell. He uses his blood as a weapon. He throws it around inflicting point damage to himself while dealing massive damage to his oppoenents. Then the blood puddles he leaves around...goodness!!! Defintely one of my favorites!!!
